# VBA-pbUtil
VBA Utility and Helper Function - MAC and PC Compatiable
Note - Some Functions Require O365 Version of Excel

## 6/7/22 Note
If you're here, you might as well bookbark this page -- I'm getting the last couple of years worth of VBA utilities and helpers, as well as some common UI items like a Picklist (that works with collections, array, or dictionaries), a 'Wait Form', and a Pivot Table Wizard -- all built in 100% VBA, 100% Worksheets (no custom controls or user forms), and 100% compatible with MAC and PC.
