# VBA-pbUtil
VBA Utility and Helper Function - MAC and PC Compatiable
Note - Some Functions Require O365 Version of Excel


## 6/13/22 Note
I've started to upload some code -- free to look around, but some of it may not compile until it added in with some static worksheets to the .xlsm file.  (I'm working on it!)

If you're here, you might as well bookbark this page -- I'm getting the last couple of years worth of VBA utilities and helpers, as well as some common UI items like a Picklist (that works with collections, array, or dictionaries), a 'Wait Form', and a Pivot Table Wizard -- all built in 100% VBA, 100% Worksheets (no custom controls or user forms), and 100% compatible with MAC and PC.
